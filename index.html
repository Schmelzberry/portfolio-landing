            <p> Hello world, my name is Jake Elsberry and I grew up in Minnesota where I attended college to obtain my
                bachelor's degree in psychology. I recently left my job as a <span class="highlight">brewer</span> and moved
                to the west coast to pursue a career in craft beer, but a difficult work-life balance made me
                consider a coding bootcamp. After my first week I feel rejuvenated and lucky to have found Epicodus. I'm
                excited to start my journey to enter the tech field. I really enjoy the process of creating webpages, cheers
                to many more!</p>

    <p> I love talking about beer, below is a little guide to making it!</p>
    <div class="column">
        <ol>
            <li> Mash in grist or crushed grain by mixing with hot liquor.</li>
            <li> Rest mash for some minutes(tends to vary on beer style). </li>
            <li> Vorlauf aka recirculate your mash to ensure homegeneity.</li>
            <li> Lauter all of that wonderful extract to a predetermined volume.</li>
            <li> Boil your wort, and carefully add the hops at correct times. Dilute beer if performing "high gravity"
                brewing</li>
            <li> Transfer after boil is complete to the whirlpool.</li>
            <li>"knock out" your beer to the fermentation vessel, pitching yeast at the desired beer temperature.</li>
            <li>After fermentation is complete, and assuming you're of age, drink that bad boi and enjoy the fruits of
                your labor! </li>
