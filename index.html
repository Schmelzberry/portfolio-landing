        <p> Hello world, my name is Jake Elsberry and I grew up in Minnesota where I attended the University of Minnesota to obtain my bachelor's degree in psychology. I recently left my job as a <span class="highlight">brewer</span>. I moved to the west coast two years ago to pursue a career in craft beer, but a difficult work-life balance made me consider a coding bootcamp. I'm stoked I found Epicodus so I could start this journey and enter a field I have always been too indimidated to enter. I really enjoy the process of creating this webpage, cheers to many more!</p>
