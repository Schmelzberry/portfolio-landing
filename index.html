        <p> Hello world, my name is Jake Elsberry and I grew up in Minnesota where I attended the University of Minnesota to obtain my bachelor's degree in psychology. I recently left my job as a <span class="highlight">brewer</span> and moved to the west coast two years ago to pursue a career in craft beer, but a difficult work-life balance made me consider a coding bootcamp. I'm stoked I found Epicodus so I could start this journey and enter a field I have always been too intimidated to enter. I really enjoy the process of creating webpages, cheers to many more!</p>

            <li> Mash in grist or crushed grain by mixing with hot liquor.</li>
            <li> Rest mash for some minutes(tends to vary on beer style). </li>
            <li> Vorlauf aka recirculate your mash to ensure homegeneity.</li>
            <li> Lauter all of that wonderful extract to a predetermined volume.</li>
            <li> Boil your wort, and carefully add the hops at correct times. Dilute beer if performing "high gravity" brewing</li>
            <li> Transfer after boil is complete to the whirlpool.</li>
            <li>"knock out" your beer to the fermentation vessel, pitching yeast at the desired temperature.</li>
