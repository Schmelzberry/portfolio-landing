    <p> Hello world, my name is Jake Elsberry and I recently left my job as a brewer. I moved to the west coast to pursue a career in craft beer, but a difficult work-life balance made me consider a coding bootcamp. I'm stoked I found Epicodus so I could start this journey. I really enjoy the process of creating this webpage, cheers to many more!</p>
