            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> Hello world, my name is Jake Elsberry, and I am originally from Minnesota. Minneapolis is the city I attended college in, to get my
                bachelor's degree in psychology. I recently left my job as a brewer and
                moved
                to the west coast to pursue a career in craft beer, but a difficult work-life balance made me
                consider a coding bootcamp. After my first week I feel rejuvenated and lucky to have found Epicodus. I'm
                excited to start my journey to enter the tech field. I really enjoy the process of creating webpages,
                cheers
                to many more!</p>
