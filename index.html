            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> Hello world! My name is Jake Elsberry(he/him). I am originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota.I recently
                left my job as a brewer to pursue a career in web development and further my knowledge of programming. I
                originally moved
                to Portland to pursue a career in craft beer, but a difficult work-life balance and an allergy to
                drinking beer has brought me to <span class='bootcamp'>Epicodus</span>. I'm excited to start my journey
                into the tech field. I really enjoy the process of creating webpages, and look forward to learning a lot
                while i'm in school.</p>

            <h2>Work Experience & Education</h2>
            <p>I began working in restaurants when I was 16 and quickly became a server. Since then, I have waited
                tables in a variety of restaurant-types and also performed full-service bartending. This work taught me
                the value of multi-tasking, teamwork, and the importance of communication. Currently, I'm passionate
                about starting a career in web development and look forward to learning about Javascript. Long term, I
                would like to be a machine learning engineer and find the building of neural networks to be fascinating.
